Task Overview:
- Simulate data for a randomly generated patient undergoing mechanical ventilation.
- The simulation should authentically capture the trial-and-error process of adjusting ventilatory settings to find the most effective weaning plan.
- Initially, focus on providing the patient with normal, comfortable respiration and gradually adjust settings for weaning.
- The initial state of the data should reflect a realistic scenario where the patient has just started on mechanical ventilation and is not yet adequately supported, in line with their diagnosis.

Patient Details:
- Gender: Randomly select (0/1)
- Age: Randomly generate (between 45 and 85 years)
- Diagnosis: Choose a realistic diagnosis that typically necessitates ICU respiratory support. This could be a respiratory system disease or respiratory difficulties resulting from complications arising from certain other diseases

Simulation Period:
- Start with the patient's initial state of just beginning mechanical ventilation support, not yet optimized.
- Randomly generate a start date and time, lasting 2 hours, with data points every 30 minutes.

Required Data Fields:
- Time Stamp (e.g., "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS")
- Ventilatory Parameters (including VTI, VTE, SPO2, RATE, FSPN, MVSPN, PPEAK, PMEAN, PPLAT, VTESPN)
- Settings (including SET_VENTMODE, SET_PINSP, SET_SLOPE, SET_TINS, SET_PSUPP, SET_PEEP, SET_TRIGGERFLOW, SET_FIO2)
- IsSuitable: A Boolean value determined by the logical consistency and clinical appropriateness of the adjustments at each point

Data Generation Guidelines:
- Initial State: Begin with the patient in a state that matches their diagnosis, showing they have just started on mechanical ventilation without adequate support. This sets the baseline from which adjustments will improve or modify the patient's condition.
- Primary Consideration: Prioritize providing the patient with comfortable breathing at the start. Subsequently, make slow, deliberate adjustments to the settings to facilitate gradual weaning.
- Introduce both effective and suboptimal adjustments to reflect the trial-and-error nature of clinical decision-making in real life. Not all changes should lead to improvement; some may initially worsen parameters or have no effect, necessitating further evaluation and adjustment.
- The IsSuitable field should indicate whether the adjustments at each time point are beneficial (true) or not (false), acknowledging that occasional setbacks are a natural part of a realistic clinical scenario.
