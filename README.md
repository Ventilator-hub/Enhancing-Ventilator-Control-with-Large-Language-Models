# Enhancing Ventilator Control with Large Language Models: Instruction Fine-tuning Datasets Curation for Maintenance and Weaning
## Maintenance Scenario

The data utilized in the Maintenance scenario is sourced from the MIMIC-III dataset. We adhere strictly to the licensing terms stipulated by the official MIMIC-III repository. Consequently, the raw dataset from MIMIC-III is not publicly available. However, we have meticulously documented the data processing methodologies and the prompts employed for data manipulation in our published paper and on our GitHub repository.

## Weaning Scenario

For the Weaning scenario, the dataset originates from a simulator role-played by GPT-4. We have made available the preliminarily filtered dataset, which includes training data, testing data, and expert-annotated data. It is important to note that the CoT-enhanced data is currently not open-sourced. Post-publication of our article, we intend to consider a phased release of the complete dataset. Additionally, the prompts used in our research are also disclosed on our GitHub repository.
