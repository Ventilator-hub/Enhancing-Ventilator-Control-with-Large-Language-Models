# Enhancing Ventilator Control with Large Language Models: Instruction Fine-tuning Datasets Curation for Maintenance and Weaning
## Maintenance Scenario

The data utilized in the Maintenance scenario is sourced from the MIMIC-III dataset. We adhere strictly to the licensing terms stipulated by the official MIMIC-III repository. Consequently, the raw dataset from MIMIC-III is not publicly available right now. However, we have documented the data processing methodologies and the prompts employed for data manipulation in our published paper and on our GitHub repository. Specifically, the prompts used in the data processing are available in the Maintenance folder of our repository. We are currently exploring various options for releasing our maintenance dataset under the licensing requirements stipulated by the official MIMIC-III guidelines. We aim to reach a conclusion prior to the conference.
## Weaning Scenario

For the Weaning scenario, the dataset originates from a simulator role-played by GPT-4. We have made available the preliminarily filtered dataset, which includes training data, testing data, and expert-annotated data. It is important to note that the CoT-enhanced data is currently not open-sourced. We will release the complete dataset following the acceptance of our paper. The dataset and the associated prompts are located in the `Weaning` folder of our repository.
