Patient Information:
- Gender: [gender]
- Age: [Age]
- Diagnosis: [diagnosis]
- Patient ID: [Id]

Current Mechanical Ventilation Monitoring Parameters ([RecordTime]):
- Inhaled Tidal Volume (VTI): [VTI]
- Exhaled Tidal Volume (VTE): [VTE]
- Respiration Rate (RATE): [RATE]
- Spontaneous Breathing Rate (FSPN): [FSPN]
- Minute Spontaneous Ventilation (MVSPN): [MVSPN]
- Peak Pressure (PPEAK): [PPEAK]
- Mean Airway Pressure (PMEAN): [PMEAN]
- Plateau Pressure (PPLAT): [PPLAT]
- Spontaneous Tidal Volume (VTESPN): [VTESPN]
- Oxygen Saturation (SPO2): [SPO2]

Analysis Process:
- Ventilator Synchrony and Tidal Volume Analysis:
  - Evaluate the difference between VTI and VTE to determine if there are significant leaks or mismatch.
  - Analyze the relationship between RATE and FSPN to assess the patient's level of spontaneous breathing activity.
- Gas Exchange and Oxygenation Assessment:
  - Combine SPO2 values to assess whether the patient's oxygenation status meets the target range.
  - Infer lung compliance and gas exchange efficiency based on PMEAN and PPLAT values.
- Ventilator Support Intensity:
  - Analyze PPEAK to evaluate if the ventilator support level is appropriate for the patient's breathing.
  - Consider the ratio between MVSPN and RATE to assess the patient's dependency on mechanical ventilation.

Decisions and Adjustments:
- Ventilation Mode (SET_VENTMODE): [SET_VENTMODE]
- Inspiratory Peak Pressure (SET_PINSP): [SET_PINSP]
- Oxygen Supply (SET_OXYGEN): [SET_OXYGEN]
- Inspired Oxygen Concentration (SET_FIO2): [SET_FIO2]
- Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (SET_PEEP): [SET_PEEP]
- Support Pressure (SET_PSUPP): [SET_PSUPP]
- Trigger Flow (SET_TRIGGERFLOW): [SET_TRIGGERFLOW]
- Rise Time (SET_SLOPE): [SET_SLOPE]
- Inhalation Time (SET_TINS): [SET_TINS]

Summary and Recommendations:
- Integrate the patient's respiratory status, gas exchange efficiency, and ventilator synchrony to propose a personalized mechanical ventilation strategy. Monitor the patient's response and adjust ventilation parameters timely based on the patient's progress, preparing the patient for gradual weaning off the ventilator.
